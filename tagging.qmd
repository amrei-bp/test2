In Git one can tag specific points in a repository’s history with an extra label, besides the commit message. This can be used to mark releases for software (`version1.0, version2.0`). 

For us it can be useful when submitting code to journals. With a tag we can freeze the code in time, so to speak, and make sure we can always find the correct version - and share it with others. 

## Lightweight versus Annotated tags

Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated. 

A `lightweight tag` is pretty much just a pointer to a specific commit.

`Annotated tags` are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).

On GitHub, tags created via the web interface are always annotated tags, because they are tied to releases.

# Creating a tag

We will create a tag via a GitHub release.

Alternatively, you could also create them on the command line in the terminal. 

In your repository, in the `Code` tab, click on `tags` (looks like a travel bag tag).

There are no releases, so we need to create one in the `Releases` tab. Fill in the necessary detail and click `Publish release`. 

This will create a zipped archive of your repository at the time of the tagging. 

# View tags

You can access the tag via the same tag button as above, and then download the tagged version of your repository. 

In RStudio, you can fetch the tag to your local repository and you will see it in the history. 

# Create a DOI for your repository

Zenodo creates a DOI for a specific GitHub release, which is why tagging your repository before submitting is important.

You can [issue a persistent identifier for your repository with Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).
